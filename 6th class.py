#list and tuple
#(list) is an orderd collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within squre brackets.
#List are mutable and can be modified after creation. In the list we can put different type of data elemonts.

#Tuples are immutable and can not be modified after creation

#Maappde data: dict
#dice: A dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair.
#The key:value pairs are enclosed within curly brackets.
#dict is a map data. Which maps one data with another.
